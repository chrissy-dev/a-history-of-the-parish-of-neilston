# A History of the Parish of Neilston

By David Pride (1910)

This book has been considered by academicians and scholars of great significance and value to literature and forms a part of the knowledge base for future generations.

In 2013 A History Of The Parish Of Neilston was released [to the Public Domain](https://archive.org/details/historyofparisho00prid) by the University of Guelph Library. 

So that the book is never forgotten I have represented this book in a web format. This will ensure this important historical work is searchable and fully accessible to all.
